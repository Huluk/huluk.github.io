          <h2>The Grove</h2>
<p class="meta">04 Jan 2015 — posted in <a href="/categories/writing">writing</a>
</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Birch grove. Two trees in front of you, one left and two more to the sides.
Behind them fields of wheat, glowing yellow and ripe into the lightly
clouded autumn skies.
The morning sun shines through the translucent leaves and lets you
experience an intense play of light and shadow between weeds and birches. To
the right a raven lets his call sound over the peaceful field.  None but you
and him are present, each ignoring the other with benevolent indifference.
An uncaringness as can only be offered to life with such different
aspirations as between man and bird.</p>

<p>With your left foot you nearly stumble over a rectangular stone, two by four
handspans on ground and one in height. A curious hollow shape carved in the
middle, giving the impression of an ancient ritual place. A druid would
certainly know the magic of this copse, but today it simply invites the
lonely traveller to rest sometime, just a few steps away from the road
behind you.</p>

<p>You realize that you hardly remember the aim of your travels, even the
existence of the road. You get the feeling that you have forgotten
something, and while you turn back to the road a darkness dawns on you, both
in the rising of a thought and in the corner of your eye. The road! You have
forgotten the road and now its world has forgotten you.</p>

<p>The darkness you sense is the shadow of the forest before you, the
innumerous amount of pine trees stretching to infinity. You know there
only ever were a handful of them between you and the road, but now their
dark green needles stand mocking and merciless, amplifying your desperation.</p>

<p>The raven cries again and blight befalls the trees. You never close your
eyes, but somehow the change in your environment escapes your perception:
Three barren pines stand before a batch of dirt. Dirt and puddles – both
quite familiar to your eye – stretching from horizon to horizon, guiding
your gaze through the golden fields of wheat. The raven blinks at you,
turns, and flies away.</p>
