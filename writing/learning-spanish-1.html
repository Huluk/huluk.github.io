          <h2>Learning Spanish 1</h2>

<div class="post">
<p>Last week I decided to lean Spanish, roughly according to the <a href="http://www.memrise.com/blog/can-you-learn-a-new-language-in-5-weeks/">study plan</a> of
Tommo Valkonen. First of, some history about why I want to do this:</p>

<p>My interest in languages started when I was some time into learning
Esperanto and I found out that such endeavors – learning a language – are
not necessarily horrible. I began to play around with foreign grammar and
looked into some other constructed languages and finally Icelandic, which I
learned – and still learn – to some extend. However, I soon met the desire
to speak a more conventionally useful language and began to study Arabic in
parallel to Icelandic and a full university schedule. This was obviously not
planned through and I soon dropped it. So, what easy but useful languages
are out there? The list is quite short: Spanish, French, and Polish for
family reasons. I don&rsquo;t currently want to put up with French spelling and
pronunciation, which leaves the other two. Reading the memrise blog post
mentioned above, I decided that a 6 week programme fits right into my
schedule: starting on May 8th and ending on June 25th, with a week of
interruption to go cycling in Norway.</p>

<p>According to the plan, I first learn the alphabet and pronunciation of the
language (yup, took an hour or so). The next step is to learn the most
common words, so that I have a base for further learning. After that, I&rsquo;ll
learn basic grammar and create some sentences. The rest of the time,
practice with real people over the internet. As an introvert, this will be
the hardest part for me, I really hope I&rsquo;m going to follow through with
this.</p>

<p>Last week, I used memrise to learn the 1000 most common Spanish
words. I heavily recommend memrise for vocab learning, but even for
oft-learned languages like Spanish, not all top listed courses are really
good. The number of learners is a good first indication of course quality,
but I recommend looking at the course forum to find out how the course
creator reacts to correction proposals. A good course also provides
information about the words (e.g. gender), but doesn&rsquo;t force you to always
type the relevant markers and accepts alternative versions of words and
other words with the same meaning. For learning, I recommend practicing
daily (with obvious exceptions for vacations and special events). This is
independent of your time frame to learn the language. If you really don&rsquo;t
find motivation to learn on a specific date, just repeat one or two words
and call it a day.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ll publish the next progress report, because there will
be a lot to do at the end of the next week. Final presentation for
Bachelor&rsquo;s degree, preparation for holiday, and all. Expect something by
June 4th.
I published this post without corrections, because I wouldn&rsquo;t publish it at
all would I force myself to make it perfect. Nonetheless, mayme you found it
interesting or even motivating to start learning a language yourself.</p>
