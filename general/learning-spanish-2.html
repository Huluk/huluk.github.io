          <h2>Learning Spanish 2</h2>

<div class="post">
<p>This is the second post about my project to learn Spanish. The final
presentation for my bachelor&rsquo;s degree and travel preparations took more time
than anticipated, so that I didn&rsquo;t get much done in the week before the
holidays (which was from May 22 to May 30 &ndash; posts on that will follow). I
was happy to see that it only took a day of repetition to get the first
thousand words back into my head. In the last week I extensively used the
duolingo Spanish course. That one is really good and is very easy to get
into. I installed the duolingo app on my mother&rsquo;s phone with an English
course for German speakers and she really likes the handling, too. The
courses are mostly based on translation tasks, whereas courses which only
teach in the target language are purportedly better for acchieving fluency.
Nonetheless it would be hard to find a higher quality online course, and
much more a free one.</p>

<p>Now, the goal was to learn the grammar and get into conversations. The
former I did, at least superficially. The latter not so much. Realistically
I will complete the duolingo course tomorrow and will have much to do in the
following days. maybe I can fit in some conversation over Skype, but
motivation will probably be low.</p>

<p>Reviewing the learning process, I&rsquo;m surprised how easy everything is.
There are many verb tenses to learn and I find the rules for object placing
very confusing, but apart from that there haven&rsquo;t been any major
difficulties. I&rsquo;m still waiting for the shoe to drop when I reach to the
subjunctive forms and special kinds of sub-clauses, should such things exist
;)</p>

<p>[I plan to update the structure and content of this post some time in the future. I&rsquo;m posting the text in this state in order to increase the pressure to edit it. If there is no update notice here, I haven&rsquo;t updated yet.]</p>
