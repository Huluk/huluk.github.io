I've never been much into writing, but occasionally it is useful to write
something for the outside world and publish it in a semi-permanent way.

I don't know yet whether this will become a blog or more of a repository and
overview page for projects. I guess it doesn't matter â€“ my main intention for
now is to not get too deeply into the tech of the blog itself. It is to be a
tool used for other purposes. As such, I'm using Jekyll, which I already used
for my last iteration of blogging in 2014/2015. This is a new setup because it
was simpler to restart than to get the old code to work.

Welcome to the blog!
